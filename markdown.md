### Headings

To write a paragraph, you simply need to write text! If you want your text to be on a seperate line, you'll need to skip a line.

No other formatting is needed to write simple paragraphs.

You can add _emphasis_ to text by wrapping the text in underscores. You can also **bold** text by adding two asterisks on either side of the text you want to bold.

You can write code inline by wrapping text in backticks. This helps distinguish code, like `let x = 10`, from other text.

```javascript
function hello(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
```

The syntax above will look like the following code when rendered:
function hello(name){
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
