            <h3>About Me</h3>      
            <p> 
                After spending some time exploring the fun world of real estate, I discovered my passion for coding after taking a weekend to build myself a simple private blog to jot down my thoughts. I loved developing so much that I entered into a flow state where time ceased to exist. Since then, I never looked back. I am now a student at Thinkful, and I am elated to be on this journey of becoming the best software engineer I can be!</p>    
            <p>
